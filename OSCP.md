#My OSCP Journey 2019#

##Intro##

I started my OSCP journey in September 2019. It took me around 2 months from beginning to end before I achieved the certification. 

##Background## 

I came into this course with a strong background in security, networking and systems admin with 20 years experience in IT in total. I have spent the last 10 years working as a full time penetration tester/ security consultant. I have worked on both red and blue team operations in various industries over the years.  


##My top tips for OSCP candidates##

1. Do your lab exercises and complete the course materials. Even if you have prior experience and have already used many of the methods you are learning in OSCP, do them anyway. You may be surprised at how the course will lead you to key concepts and questions that expand on what you already know. Perhaps they may change the system so that your favorite go to methods do not work. Perhaps you will learn how to deal with certain speed bumps or certain errors. Keep in mind, one can immediately identify people who did not do their course materials simply by the questions they are asking. Dont be the guy who did not read the manual.

2. Use your lab time effectively. Offensive Security has gone through great pain to create the ultimate learning environment. You have the ultimate test guinea pig in that you can test almost any attack you can imagine on any lab target. Leave your ego at the door, you are not there to prove you can hack every box in the fastest time possible, so rushing to the quickest easiest exploit you can find will not benefit you in any way. Yes the lab machines are much older and left unpatched so there are some quick wins but these are not always intended. Don't lose out on learning by using quick wins, use the time to refine your method, determine how to get around obstacles and work on your weaknesses. Find the intended methods for each box and recheck if there are any alternate methods to root. Redo each pwn taking note step by step of every difficulty you encountered and how you overcame that difficulty. Make sure to reset every lab target you intend to work on , I wasted many days trying to hack targets that were not working correctly as a result of another students testing. This is time I would rather have spent more constructively. 

3. Know when to try harder. It is very easy to spend hours or even days going down a rabbit hole. You will not have this kind of time during your exam so determining what observations to action and knowing when to persist is key to success. Use your lab time to hone this sense in particular. Record yourself, Observe yourself, analyze specific things you missed and how you determined right or wrong later on. Is there a way to automate or include them in your checklist. Put things you learn into the bank (in your notes) and incorporate them into some of your scripts if you can. If you notice yourself making the same mistake over and over , put a note in front of you on a post-it, white-board or something that is in plain sight as a constant reminder. Try not to be your own worst nightmare.   

4. I have said this before but this deserves its own spot. Refine your method. Know what to do when you hit speedhumps that prevent you from doing what you intend to do. You will not have time to fumble around in the dark during your exam. By exam day your method should be well honed,you should be decisive and precise instead of being the teenager fumbling with your gf's bra clasp for the first time. I know it sounds crude, but passing the exam will boil down to knowing what to do in those situations so it is best to experience as many such situations as you can during your practice time in the labs.
