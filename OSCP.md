# OSCP Tips #

## My Background ## 

I started my OSCP journey in September 2019. It took me around 2 months from beginning to end before I achieved the certification. I came into this course with a strong background in security, networking and systems admin with 20 years experience in Information Technology in total. I have spent the last 10 years working as a full time penetration tester/ security consultant. I have worked on both red and blue team operations in various industries over the years.  

## Top tips for OSCP candidates ##

1. Do your lab exercises and complete the course materials. Even if you have prior experience and have already used many of the methods you are learning in OSCP, do them anyway. You may be surprised at how the course will lead you to key concepts and questions that assist with your learning experience. Keep in mind, one can immediately identify people who did not do their course materials simply by the questions they are asking. Dont be the guy who did not read the manual.

2. Use your lab time effectively. Offensive Security has gone through great pain to create the ultimate learning environment. You have the ultimate test environment in which you practice many famous exploits learning valuable lessons along the way. Leave your ego at the door, you are not there to prove you can hack every box in the fastest time possible, so rushing to the quickest easiest exploit you can find will not benefit you in any way. Yes the lab machines are much older and left unpatched so there are some quick wins but these are not always intended. Use the time to refine your method, determine how to get around obstacles and work on your weaknesses. Find the intended methods for each box and recheck if there are any alternate methods to root. Redo each pwn taking note step by step of every difficulty you encountered and how you overcame that difficulty. Make sure to reset every lab target you intend to work on , I wasted many days trying to hack targets that were not working correctly as a result of another students testing. This is time I would rather have spent more constructively. 

3. Know when to try harder. It is very easy to spend hours or even days going down a rabbit hole. You will not have this kind of time during your exam so determining what observations to action and knowing when to persist is key to success. Use your lab time to hone this sense in particular. Record yourself, Observe yourself, analyze specific things you missed and how you determined right or wrong later on. Is there a way to automate or include them in your checklist. Put things you learn into the bank (in your notes) and incorporate them into some of your scripts if you can. Dont shoot blindly into the dark, your actions should be based on what you are observing and not the odd chance of success from trying every exploit until one works.You will not have enough time to do this during the exam. If you notice yourself making the same mistake repeatedly, place a note on your screen using a post-it, a note on a white-board or anything that is within line of sight to serve as a constant reminder that will guide you back to your method. Try not to be your own worst nightmare. 

4. I have said this before but this deserves its own spot. Refine your method. Know what to do when you hit speedhumps that prevent you from completing a hack. You will not have time to fumble around in the dark during your exam. By the time you take your exam your method should be well honed, you should be decisive and precise instead of being a clumsy teenager fumbling with your girlfriend's bra clasp for the very first time. Passing the exam will boil down to knowing what to do in each situation, overcomming each difficulty as quickly as possible and moving on to bank more points.I have included multiple resources that I used for my exam preparation below. Some of the links below provide multiple fallback methods that can be used based on different scenarios. I would suggest spending time practicing some of them in the lab if possible. Some talks are long so have a notepad ready.
